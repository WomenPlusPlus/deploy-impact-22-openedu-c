    "\n",
    "The idea of document summarization is a\n",
    "bit different from keyphrase extraction or topic modeling. In this case, the end result\n",
    "is still in the form of some document, but with a few sentences based on the length we\n",
    "might want the summary to be. This is similar to an abstract or an executive summary\n",
    "in a research paper. The main objective of automated document summarization is\n",
    "to perform this summarization without involving human input, except for running\n",
    "computer programs. Mathematical and statistical models help in building and\n",
    "automating the task of summarizing documents by observing their content and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two broad approaches to document summarization using automated\n",
    "techniques. They are described as follows:\n",
    "- __Extraction-based techniques:__ These methods use mathematical\n",
    "and statistical concepts like SVD to extract some key subset of the\n",
    "content from the original document such that this subset of content\n",
    "contains the core information and acts as the focal point of the entire\n",
    "document. This content can be words, phrases, or even sentences.\n",
    "The end result from this approach is a short executive summary of a\n",
    "couple of lines extracted from the original document. No new content\n",
    "is generated in this technique, hence the name extraction-based.\n",
    "- __Abstraction-based techniques:__ These methods are more complex\n",
    "and sophisticated. They leverage language semantics to create\n",
    "representations and use natural language generation (NLG)\n",
    "techniques where the machine uses knowledge bases and semantic\n",
    "representations to generate text on its own and create summaries\n",
    "just like a human would write them. Thanks to deep learning, we can\n",
    "implement these techniques easily but they require a lot of data and\n",
    "compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover extraction based methods here due to constraints of needed a lot of data + compute for abstraction based methods. But you can leverage the seq2seq models you learnt in language translation on an appropriate dataset to build deep learning based abstractive summarizers"

    "The game's main story revolves around the player character's quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, \n",
    "a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The game is set 200 years after the events of Oblivion \n",
    "and takes place in the fictional province of Skyrim. Over the course of the game, the player completes \n",

    "its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time, and to ignore \n",
    "or postpone the main storyline indefinitely.\n",
    "The team opted for a unique and more diverse open world than Oblivion's Imperial Province of Cyrodiil, \n",
    "which game director and executive producer Todd Howard considered less interesting by comparison. \n",

    "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing game, playable from either a first or \n",

    "rely on the main storyline being at least partially completed. Non-player characters (NPCs) populate the \n",
    "world and can be interacted with in a number of ways: the player may engage them in conversation, \n",
    "marry an eligible NPC, kill them or engage in a nonlethal \"brawl\". The player may \n",
    "choose to join factions which are organized groups of NPCs — for example, the Dark Brotherhood, a band \n",

    "in the game world has jobs that the player can engage in, such as farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Players have the option to develop their character. At the beginning of the game, players create \n",
    "their character by selecting their sex and choosing between one of several races including humans, \n",
    "orcs, elves, and anthropomorphic cat or lizard-like creatures and then customizing their character's \n",
    "appearance. Over the course of the game, players improve their character's skills which are numerical \n",
    "representations of their ability in certain areas. There are eighteen skills divided evenly among the \n",
    "three schools of combat, magic, and stealth. When players have trained skills enough to meet the \n",
    "required experience, their character levels up. Health is depleted primarily when the player \n",
    "takes damage and the loss of all health results in death. Magicka is depleted by the use of spells, \n",
